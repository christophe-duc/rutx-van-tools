## About The Project

This repository contains 2 utilities that I uses inside of a RUTX11 (should be compatible with others) to record GPS information while driving my van and then a second tool to generate maps with the recorded track on it.

### Built with

 * gps-track.sh is written in shell script and has no dependencies

 * generate-maps.py is written in python (I use python3, I haven't tested it with python2) and use mapbox to generate the image (you will need a mapbox token, it's free you just have to register)
